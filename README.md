## WorldCupSokerban Description
This is a soccer-themed, 3D sokoban puzzle game that includes 3 embedded solvers.

It has undo (u) and restart (r) functions.  Comes with many puzzle files, each typically having dozens of "levels".  The next (n) and previous (p) keys move between levels.  The (Lshft) and (Rshft) keys move between the different puzzle files (there are currently 60).  The (z) key creates a setpoint (reZero) so that subsequent restarts restore that setpoint.

To move the "pusher" use the arrow keys, ijkl keys, or wasd keys.  The objective is to kick all the red and blue balls into the goal nets.  Notice that these strange soccer balls roll in two perpendicular directions only!

The (=)-key or the (,)-key or the (.)-key trigger embedded solvers that helps you when you get stuck.  You can single-step to a final solution, or to just part way toward the solution, in order to give you a hint. This feature is essential to learning to solve on your own.

Note: all 3 solvers can fail if the puzzle is too large or difficult, so the default timeout is 10 seconds, yet is user-adjustable.

The mouse can be used to control the game viewpoint.  The mouse wheel adjusts the eye distance;  a left button drag changes view angle;  a right button click restores the default view settings.  

Works on PCs running Windows, OSX, or GNU/Linux.



--------------------------
## Features:
 * laptop friendly;
 * user definable puzzles can be added;
 * many predefined puzzles ranging from easy to nearly impossible;
 * Windows, OSX, GNU/linux binaries included;
 * full source code;
 * uses OpenAL for the sounds, GLFW3 for input & window management;
 * fully OpenGL 3.3 core profile Ada code;
 * includes 3 "live" embedded autosolvers that help you to learn;
 * no installation
 * no dependencies
 * simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run.
 * or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.


----------------------------------------------
## Embedded Autosolver Function
Three autosolvers are now embedded within this application so that pressing the (".")-key at any time initiates an attempt by the primary solver [puller] to solve the present state of the current puzzle within a limited amount of time.  If successful then you will see an onscreen prompt to continue to press the same key to single-step toward the solution.  Otherwise you will see no such prompt.  These embedded solvers are good for small and dense layouts;  but not so good at large, sparse, or difficult puzzles.

Similarly, the 2nd alternate solver [ibox] is initiated with the (",")-key.
The 3rd alternate solver [hbox] is initiated with the ("=")-key and is the most capable.

Thus, you can give yourself a headstart toward a correct solution by limited use of this feature.  Once you think you can solve it yourself, stop using the equal-key and proceed manually.  This really helps when you cannot see what your next move should be.

Embedded autosolver failure might imply the present state of the puzzle is impossible to solve, or simply that the autosolver failed due to time constraint, or insufficient capability.


The default **timeout** used by embedded solvers is adjustable using the (+)-key or (-)-key on the number keypad to increment or decrement by 10 seconds per press. This is the time to wait for the internal autosolvers before giving up. The default is 10 seconds.

Also, the **method** used by embedded solver Hbox is now set using the m-key...


### Summary:
solver keys [within parentheses]:

*	(=) hbox [most capable];
*	(,) bfs#2 [ibox; medium]
*	(.) bfs#3 [iplr; best for small or dense puzzles]; 
*	(+) increase timeout (numKeypad)
*	(-) decrease timeout (numKeypad)
*  (m) menu to set hbox method


### Method options for hbox:
There are many hbox solution methods to choose from including 5 basic methods,
each of which has several variations, because hbox is currently being used 
as a research tool.
See ~/docs/solmethods.txt for choices available within this app.
See ~/docs/SolMethodsIndex.txt for an exhaustive listing for the external hbox solver.

Even more information can be found by studying the documents in:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hbox4/files/latest/download







## External Autosolvers
There are three external autosolvers without time constraints, and larger memory constraints.
There are many large or sparse puzzles the first two solvers cannot handle, but they are pretty good at solving the small dense ones. Hbox is the most capable.

To run type:  [exeName puzzleFile LevelToSolve]

EG on windows type:

	external_solvers\iplr3r.exe games\pico_22.sok 3

...to solve the 3rd level in file pico_22.sok.

EG on linux type:

	external_solvers/hbox_gnu games/pico_22.sok 3

EG on OSX type:

	external_solvers/ibox3r_osx games/pico_22.sok 3



----------------------------------------------
## what is special about this project?
It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows, OSX, GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, OpenAL Audio with a homebrew binding, and a GNAT compiler.

The linux-build can run on multiple Linux distros!
The Windows build can run on Win10 + Win11.

I am short of testers, and would appreciate any feedback...
Open source Ada developers are welcome to help improve or extend this app.

-----------------------
## Setup & Running:

Mac/OSX users should read "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users should read "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  

* On Linux & Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

* On OSX, Keka works well for 7Z files. The command-line for Keka is:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)

After the archive is unzipped...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

You will see a new directory, that may be renamed.

Users should then cd to the install-directory, then, at the command line, type the executable name to start the game.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users type:

* sokerban_osx

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type 

* sokerban.bat 

from the installation directory. Or to set the standard default of 10 seconds wait before giving up for internal solvers type:

* binw64\sokerban.exe 10.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users can type:

* sokerban_gnu

Here too, 

* sokerban_gnu 30.0 

sets internal solver wait to 30 seconds.

You can also run the windows EXEs on Linux under wine thusly:

* wine cmd < sokerban.bat
* wine binw64/sokerban.exe

Note: I suggest that Windows users DO NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux]; that mode is not supported. Simply use the windows version.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The install-directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", and "games".


The linux executable must have access to ./libs unless your system already has the libraries it contains.  Then, at the command line type:

* sokerban_gnu



## Controls

The WASD or IJKL or arrow keys control movements.

View Controls:

* Your mouse can pan [up/down] & zoom

Also, the keyboard controls are:

* (esc), (q)  Quit

* (h) HELP
* (g) toggle avatar Gender

* (c) zoom Closer
* (f) zoom Further
* (o) zoom default reset

* (PgUp) move viewpoint North
* (PgDn) move viewpoint South

* (/) tilt upward
* (\\) tilt downward

* (+) keyPadPlus: add 10 seconds to solver wait time
* (-) keyPadMinus: subtract 10 seconds from solver wait time

* (=) try to autosolve (method #1 = hbox => most capable)
* (,) try to autosolve (method #2 = ibox3r => fewest pushes)
* (.) try to autosolve (method #3 = iplr3r => fewest moves)

* (m) set solution method for hbox

You can download my hbox stand-alone sokoban solver for greater details:

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/hbox4/    (4 is not a typo)


Other controls, as indicated by the help screen:

* (esc) to quit
* (u) to undo a move
* (r) reset to the setPt;   
* (enter) restart puzzle

* (n) next-level in current file
* (p) previous-level in current file

* (L-shift) previous file
* (R-shift) next file

* (z) reZero...define new setpoint
* (x) dump state to file Pdump.sok
* (b)     show box-Invalid cells
* (space) show freeSpace cells
* (y) toggle graphical details


Note also that a specific sokoban file may be loaded by naming it on the terminal window command line with the following syntax:

* [sokerban] sokfilepath maxlevels startlevel

where [sokerban] can be 
	sokerban_gnu, sokerban_osx or binw64\sokerban.exe

For example on linux you could type

* sokerban_gnu games/original_50.sok 50 2

to tackle level 2 from the original_50 sokoban file.  In this single-file mode, you can still use the next-level(n) & previous-level(p) keys, however, the next/previous files (R-shift/L-shift) keys are disabled.



## Limitations
This app can handle up to a maximum of 128 boxes, 64 rows/cols, up to 255 box-valid interior cells.




================================================================
## Build Requirements:
 * a recent GNAT Ada compiler;
 * OpenGL 3.3 (or better) and a graphics card that supports it.



================================================================
## Build instructions:

cccgnu.sh/cccosx.sh/ccc.bat are the build scripts for the autosolvers "hbox", "iplr3r" and "ibox3r".


The following build scripts work for GNU Ada [with its own g++],
which are in the ~/buildScripts/ directory:


-------------------------------------------------------
* msWin64 => setpath64.bat + wbuildall.bat

Please read ~/docs/gnuAdaOnWindows.txt.


------------------------------------------------------
* Mac/OSX => obuildall.sh

------------------------------------------------------
* GNU/Linux => lbuildall.sh  

utilizes the relocatable libraries that I deliver in this bundle under ./libs/.  I use this to build the gnu/linux executable that I deliver named sokerban, which should run in the presence of ./libs.

------------------------------------------------------
If the delivered linux binary does not run...

if you have wine installed, this should work:

* wine binw64/sokerban.exe

OR you can:

* Manually install GNU Ada compiler. See "gnuAdaOnWindows.txt".
* Rerun the compile script lbuildall.sh.
