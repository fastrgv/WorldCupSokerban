## WorldCupSokerban Description
This is a soccer-themed, 3D sokoban puzzle game that includes 3 external solvers and 2 embedded solvers.

It has undo (u) and restart (r) functions.  Comes with many puzzle files, each typically having dozens of "levels".  The next (n) and previous (p) keys move between levels.  The (Lshft) and (Rshft) keys move between the different puzzle files (there are currently 60).  The (z) key creates a setpoint (reZero) so that subsequent restarts restore that setpoint.

To move the "pusher" use the arrow keys, ijkl keys, or wasd keys.  The objective is to kick all the red and blue balls into the goal nets.  Notice that these strange soccer balls roll in two perpendicular directions only!

The (=)-key or the (.)-key or the (,)-key triggers embedded solvers that helps you when you get stuck.  You can single-step to a final solution, or to just part way toward the solution, in order to give you a hint. This feature is essential to learning to solve on your own.

The mouse can be used to control the game viewpoint.  The mouse wheel adjusts the eye distance;  a left button drag changes view angle;  a right button click restores the default view settings.  MacBooks can simulate these actions, as noted below.

Works on Macs running OSX and PCs running Windows or GNU/Linux.


--------------------------
## Features:
 * laptop friendly;
 * user definable puzzles;
 * many predefined puzzles ranging from easy to nearly impossible;
 * Windows, GNU/linux and OSX binaries included;
 * full source code;
 * supports high DPI mode on OSX Retina displays;
 * uses OpenAL for the sounds, GLFW3 for input & window management;
 * fully OpenGL 3.3 core profile Ada code;
 * includes 3 "live" embedded autosolvers that help you to learn;

 * no installation
 * no dependencies
 * simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run.
 * or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.

----------------------------------------------
## Embedded Autosolver Function
Three autosolvers are now embedded within this application so that pressing the ("=")-key at any time initiates an attempt by the primary solver [puller] to solve the present state of the current puzzle within a limited amount of time.  If successful then you will see an onscreen prompt to continue to press the same key to single-step toward the solution.  Otherwise you will see no such prompt.  These embedded solvers are good for small and dense layouts;  but not so good at large, sparse puzzles.

Similarly, the 2nd alternate solver [hbox4] is initiated with the (".")-key.
And the 3rd alternate solver [ibox] is initiated with the (",")-key.

Thus, you can give yourself a headstart toward a correct solution by limited use of this feature.  Once you think you can solve it yourself, stop using the equal-key and proceed manually.  This really helps when you cannot see what your next move should be.

Embedded autosolver failure might imply the present state of the puzzle is impossible to solve, or simply that the autosolver failed due to time constraint, or insufficient capability.

Finally, a single command-line argument (decimal float) specifies a persistent timeout interval to wait for the internal autosolver before giving up.  The default is 10.0 seconds.  A new setting remains in effect until a different setting is specified using a command-line argument. 


## External Autosolvers
Remember that there are still three external autosolvers without time constraints.  Subject to several limitations, typing: "solver-name puzzle-file-name.sok maxlevels level-number" will attempt to solve a particular puzzle for you, where solver-name is either "iplr3r", "ibox3r" or "hbox4".  There are many large or sparse [lishout] puzzles the first two solvers cannot handle, but they are pretty good at sovling the small dense ones.  Use the script ccc.sh to compile either solver for your operating system (assuming the presence of an Ada compiler).

The command to build them both linux is simply:
	cccgnu.sh ibox3r
	cccgnu.sh iplr3r
	cccgnu.sh hbox4

On Windows use ccc.bat.
On OSX use cccosx.sh.


To run type:  [exeName puzzleFile TotalLevels LevelToSolve]

EG on windows type:
	binw64\iplr3r games\pico_22.sok 22 3
	...to solve the 3rd level in file pico_22.sok.

EG on OSX type:
	ibox3r_osx games/pico_22.sok 22 3

EG on linux type:
	hbox4_gnu games/pico_22.sok 22 3



----------------------------------------------
## what is special about this project?
It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OSX systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, OpenAL Audio with a homebrew binding, and a GNAT compiler.



-----------------------
## Setup & Running:

Windows users should read "windows-setup.txt".
Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".


Requires Windows, OSX(>=10.13) or GNU/linux with a graphics card that supports OpenGL version 3.3;

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.
The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

You will see a new directory appear, that you may rename.

Users should then cd to the install-directory, then, at the command line, type the executable name to start the game.

Windows users type "sokerban.bat" from the installation directory. Or to set the standard default of 10 seconds wait before giving up for internal solvers type:
	binw64\sokerban.exe 10.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users can type "sokerban_gnu" or double click the icon for sokerban_gnu in file manager. Here too, sokerban_gnu 10.0 sets internal solver wait to 10 seconds.

You can also run the windows EXEs under wine thusly:

	* wine cmd < sokerban.bat
	* wine binw64/sokerban.exe

Note: I suggest that Windows users DO NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux]; that mode is not supported. Simply use the windows version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users note that this game may be initiated in two ways.  First, by opening a terminal, navigating to the install-directory, and typing "sokerban_osx" on the command line.  Second by navigating to the installation directory in Finder and clicking the "sokerban.app" icon named "Sokerban".  Here, sokerban_osx 10.0 sets the internal solver wait to 10 seconds.

Note also that a 2-finger-swipe simulates the mouse wheel on a MacBook;  and a 2-finger click simulates the right button click to restore view settings, while a 1-finger click and drag simulates the left button drag on a mouse.

The install-directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", and "games".


The GNU/linux executable must have access to ./libs unless your system already has the libraries it contains.  Then, at the command line type:

	sokerban_gnu ( or sokerban_osx, or sokerban.bat )

Remember, the WASD or IJKL or arrow keys control movements.

View Controls: 
* Your mouse can pan & zoom
* box-click:  possible destinations
* goal-click: possible sources

Also, the keyboard controls are:
* (c) zoom Closer
* (f) zoom Further
* (o) zoom default
* (/) tilt up
* (\\) tilt down
* (=) try to autosolve (method #1 = iplr3r)
* (.) try to autosolve (method #2 = hbox4 => most capable)
* (,) try to autosolve (method #3 = ibox3r)
* (h) HELP
* (b) Male Avatar (Boy)
* (g) Female Avatar (Girl)

Other controls, as indicated by the help screen:
* (esc) to quit
* (u) to undo
* (r) reset@setPt;   (1) restart puzzle
* (n) next-level in current file
* (p) previous-level in current file
* (L-shift) previous file
* (R-shift) next file
* (z) reZero the setpoint

Note also that a specific sokoban file may be tested by naming it on the terminal window command line with the following syntax:

	sokerban sokfilepath maxlevels startlevel

where sokerban can be sokerban_gnu, sokerban_osx or sokerban.bat.

For example on linux you could type

	"sokerban_gnu games/original_50.sok 50 2"

to tackle level 2 from the original_50 sokoban file.  In this single-file mode, you can still use the next-level(n) & previous-level(p) keys, however, the next/previous files (R-shift/L-shift) keys are disabled.


================================================================
## Build Requirements:
 * a recent GNAT Ada compiler;
 * OpenGL 3.3 (or better) and a graphics card that supports it.



================================================================
## Build instructions:

ccc.sh/cccosx.sh/ccc.bat are the build scripts for the autosolvers "hbox4", "iplr3r" and "ibox3r".


The following build scripts work for GNU Ada [with its own g++].


-------------------------------------------------------
msWin64 => wbuildall.bat

build script that requires libraries included in ./binw64/
Please read ~/docs/gnuAdaOnWindows.txt.


-------------------------------------------------------
MacOSX:

(obuildall.sh):  build script for generating a portable executable that will run on most recent OSX platforms whether or not they have non-standard libraries such as GLEW, GLFW3, SFML installed.  I used this to build the executable that I deliver, named sokerban_osx.  This script references delivered static library files for nonstandard libs.

------------------------------------------------------
GNU/Linux:  

(lbuildall.sh):  utilizes the relocatable libraries that I deliver in this bundle under ./libs/.  I use this to build the gnu/linux executable that I deliver named sokerban_gnu, which should run in the presence of ./libs.

If the delivered linux binary does not run...

* Manually install GNU Ada compiler. See "gnuAdaOnWindows.txt".
* Rerun the compile script lbuildall.sh.

## Media Files:

### General Note
The particular choice of sound and image files delivered are not essential to the function of the game and are easily replaced.  This software is primarily intended as a tutorial example of modern OpenGL methods.  The only requirements are that sounds be in WAV format and images be in PNG format.

It is my intention to use media with copyrights or licenses that are compatible with GPLv3. Please notify me if you believe there is an incompatibility, and it will be removed ASAP, eg a CC-by-NC license is NOT GPL compatible.



### SoundFiles
Andres Cantor sound downloaded from YouTube and trimmed with FFMPEG.  Kick sound is from freesound.org so is covered by the Creative Commons CC0 License;  see the file creativeCommons.txt.

### ImageFiles
...for textures were freely [no copyright indications] available on google images.  Files for text-textures were created using gimp and are also covered by the GNU GPL v3 license.  The pusher man is modified from a skin by Anders Widell, so thanks to Anders for that.  An alternate pusher is also available that was obtained from OpenGameArt.org and created by felixschuett with a CC0 license.
